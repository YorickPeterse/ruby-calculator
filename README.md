# Ruby Calculator

Basic boilerplate and tests for writing a basic calculator in Ruby. The goal of
this repository is to provide a basic framework for writing a basic and rather
boring calculator. This calculator should be capable of processing expressions
such as the following:

    10 + 10   # => 20
    5 * 3 + 2 # => 17
    10 / 2    # => 5

The following operators should be implemented:

* addition: `+`
* division: `/`
* multiplication: `*`
* subtraction: `-`

You're free to implement more if you'd like. When you do, make sure you write
some tests for it.

## Requirements

* Ruby 1.9.3 or newer
* Bundler

## Setup

The first step would be to fork this repository to your own account as the
canonical one serves as a basic template. Once done, clone the repository
locally and install the required Gems:

    bundle install

Next up, run the tests (which will fail by default):

    rake

You can now start writing your basic calculator. Don't forget to commit your
changes Once done be sure to ping @yorickpeterse for feedback, you'll probably
have him on Skype or IRC (or something else) if you're working through this.
